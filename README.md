## Details for teaching team
This is my first time working with Bootstrap or Sass. Ideally the .css files generated by Sass wouldn't be included in the repo but then the production server would need build tools to compile them instead of just pulling them.

## Outside code
* [bootstrap-sass](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass) Official Sass port of Bootstrap 
* [Bootstrap Navbar Template](http://getbootstrap.com/examples/navbar/) Example of Bootstrap navbar
