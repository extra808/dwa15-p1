## Details for teaching team
This is my first time working with Bootstrap or Sass. Ideally the .css files generated by Sass wouldn't be included in the repo but then the production server would need build tools to compile them instead of just pulling them.

I'm interested in trying responsive images but only ended up adding a "retina" image so I didn't feel the need to use a [polyfill](https://scottjehl.github.io/picturefill/) to make it work in browsers that don't support it, it's a progressive enhancement.

I checked my site on [Google's PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/), the main change I made as a result was to change the spacing in the navigation to make the links (or what will become links) easier to tap on a mobile device.
